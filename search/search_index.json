We welcome feedback from interested parties regarding limitations and/or potential extensions to the schema! Similarly, while the \"ideal\" schema will support arbitrary dimensions (i.e. more than the conventional position, time, channel, z, ...), it also hard to avoid hard-coding some assumptions about dimensionality in certain places.
